<span class="i0">That though <i>Leonidas</i> our brave General<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever came home a fair and great example,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of our <i>Leonidas</i> wisdom and his valour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Followed by a desire to be a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon what terms soever to such goodness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had an enterview; and that their friendship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might with our peace be ratified, 'twas concluded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Agenor</i> yielding up all such strong places<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A Marriage without her leave, or knowledge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To leave his Mistriss, but compell'd him when<br /></span>

<h2>The Knight of the Burning Pestle.</h2>


<h3><i>To the Readers of this COMEDY.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>, the World is so nice in these our times, that
for Apparel, there is no fashion, For Musick, which is a
rare Art, (though now slighted) No Instrument; For Diet,
none but the <i>French</i> Kickshoes that are delicate; and for Plaies,
no invention but that which now runneth an invective way,
touching some particular persons, or else it is contemned before
it is throughly understood. This is all that I have to say, That
the Author had no intent to wrong any one in this <i>Comedy</i>, but
as a merry passage, here and there interlaced it with delight,
which he hopes will please all, and be hurtful to none.</p></div>


<h3>The PROLOGUE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Where the Bee can suck no Honey, she leaves her sting behind;</i>
<i>and where the Bear cannot find</i> Origanum <i>to heal</i>
<i>his grief, he blasteth all other leaves with his breath. We fear it</i>
<i>is like to fare so with us; that seeing you cannot draw from our</i>
<i>labours sweet content, you leave behind you a sower mis-like, and</i>
<i>with open reproach blame our good meaning, because you cannot reap</i>
<i>the wonted mirth. Our intent was at this time to move inward</i>
<i>delight, not outward lightness; and to breed (if it might be) soft</i>
<i>smiling, not loud laughing: knowing it (to the wise) to be a great</i>
<i>pleasure, to hear Counsel mixed with Wit, as to the foolish to have</i>
<i>sport mingled with rudeness. They were banished the Theater of</i>
Athens, <i>and from</i> Rome <i>hissed, that brought Parasites on t[h]e</i>
<i>Stage with apish actions, or Fools with uncivil habits, or Courtezans</i>
<i>with immodest words. We have endeavoured to be as far</i>
<i>from unseemly speeches, to make your ears glow, as we hope you will</i>
<i>be free from unkind reports, or mistaking the Authors intention</i>
<i>(who never aimed at any one particular in this Play,) to make our</i>
<i>cheeks blush. And thus I leave it, and thee to thine own censure, to</i>
<i>like, or dislike.</i> Vale.</p></div>

said: All happy Knight, the mirror of all such as follow Arms,
now may I be well assured of the love thou bearest me, I
wonder why the Kings do not raise an Army of fourteen or
fifteen hundred thousand men, as big as the Army that the

call Damn'd bitch.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> But what brave spirit could be content to sit in
his shop with a flapet of Wood, and a blew Apron before him
selling <i>Methridatam</i> and <i>Dragons water</i> to visited houses, that

have little list to sing, I-wisse.</p>

<p><i>Old Mer.</i> It should never be consider'd, while it were an

<p><i>Mist. Mer.</i> But how wilt thou do <i>Charles</i>, thou art an

<p><i>Old Mer.</i> How? why how have I done hitherto these
forty years? I never came into my Dining-room, but at eleven
and six a clock, I found excellent meat and drink a'th' Table:
my Cloaths were never worn out, but next morning a Tailor
brought me a new suit; and without question it will be so
ever! Use makes perfectness. If all should fail, it is but a little

<p><i>Ham.</i> I hope so Captain.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Charge upon me, 'tis with the weakest: put more

<p><i>Green.</i> And like you master Captain, I made a shot even
now, partly to scour her, and partly for audacity.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> It should seem so certainly, for her breath is yet
inflamed: besides, there is a main fault in the touch-hole, it
runs and stinketh; and I tell you moreover, and believe it.
Ten such touch-holes would breed the Pox in the Army. Get
you a Feather, neighbor, get you a Feather, sweet Oil, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>

your Powder?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Here.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> What in a Paper? As I am a Soldier and a Gentleman,
it craves a Martial Court: you ought to die for't. Where's
your horn? answer me to that.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> An't like you Sir, I was oblivious.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> It likes me not it should be so; 'tis a shame for
you, and a scandal to all our Neighbors, being a man of worth
and estimation, to leave your horn behind you: I am afraid
'twill breed example. But let me tell you no more on't; stand,
till I view you all. What's become o'th' nose of your flaske?</p>

<p><i>1 Sold.</i> Indeed law Captain, 'twas blown away with
powder.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Put on a new one at the Cities Charge. Where's
the stone of this Peece?</p>

<p><i>2 Sold.</i> The Drummer took it out to light Tobacco.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> 'Tis a fault my friend, put it in again: you want
a Nose, and you a Stone; Serjeant, take a note on't, for I
mean to stop it in the pay. Remove and march, soft and
fair Gentlemen; soft and fair: double and files, as you were,
faces about. Now you with the sodden face, keep in there:
look to your Match sirrah, it will be in your fellows flask
anon. So make a Crescent now, advance your Pikes, stand
and give ear, Gentlemen, Countrey-men, Friends, and my
fellow-Soldiers, I have brought you this day from the Shop[s]
of Security, and the Counters of Content, to measure out in
these furious fields, Honor by the ell, and Prowess by the
pound: Let it not, O let it not, I say, be told hereafter,
the noble issue of this City fainted: but bear your selves in
this fair action, like men, valiant men, and free men: Fear not
the face of the enemy: nor the noise of the Guns: for believe
me brethren, the rude rumbling of a Brewers Carr is [farre]
more terrible, of which you have a daily experience: Neither
let the stink of Powder offend you, since a more valiant stink is
nightly with you. To a resolved mind, his home is every
where: I speak not this to take away the hope of your return;
for you shall see (I do not doubt it) and that very shortly,
your loving wives again, and your sweet children, whose care
doth bear you company in baskets. Remember then whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
cause you have in hand, and like a sort of true-born Scavengers,
scour me this famous Realm of enemies. I have no more to
say but this: Stand to your tacklings lads, and shew to the
world, you can as well brandish a sword, as shake an Apron.

<p class="hangingindent"><i>In the following references to the text the lines are numbered from the top of the</i>
<i>page, including titles, acts, stage directions, &amp;c., but not, of course, the</i>
<i>headline or mere 'rules.' Where, as in the lists of Persons Represented,</i>
<i>there are double columns, the right-hand column is numbered after the left.</i></p>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear. Altered
punctuation is shown, usually, by printing the old punctuation between the
preceding and following words.</p>

<p>(<b>A</b>) The | Knight of | the Burning Pestle. | Quod si | Indicium subtile,
videndis artibus illud | Ad libros &amp; ad h&aelig;c Musarum dona vocares: | B&oelig;otum
in crasso iurares a&euml;re natum. | Horat. in Epist. ad Oct. Aug. | London, |
Printed for Walter Burre, and are to be sold at the signe of the Crane in
Paules Church-yard. | 1613.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To his many | waies endeered | friend Maister Robert Keysar. | <i>Sir, this</i>
<i>unfortunate child, who in eight daies (as lately I have learned) was begot and</i>
<i>borne, soone after, was by his parents (perhaps because hee was so unlike his</i>
<i>brethren) exposed to the wide world, who for want of judgement, or not understanding</i>
<i>the privy marke of</i> Ironie <i>about it (which shewed it was no of-spring</i>
<i>of any vulgar braine) utterly rejected it: so that for want of acceptance it was</i>
<i>even ready to give up the Ghost, and was in danger to have bene smothered in</i>
<i>perpetuall oblivion, if you (out of your direct</i> antipathy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span><i>to ingratitude) had not</i>
<i>bene moved both to relieve and cherish it: wherein I must needs commend both</i>
<i>your judgement, understanding, and singular love to good wits; you afterwards</i>
<i>sent it to mee, yet being an infant and somewhat ragged, I have fostred it privately</i>
<i>in my bosome these two yeares, and now to shew my love returne it to you, clad</i>
<i>in good lasting cloaths, which scarce memory will weare out, and able to speake</i>
<i>for it selfe; and withall, as it telleth mee, desirous to try his fortune in the</i>
<i>world, where if yet it be welcome, father, foster-father, nurse and child, all have</i>
<i>their desired end. If it bee slighted or traduced, it hopes his father will beget</i>
<i>him a yonger brother, who shall revenge his quarrell, and challenge the world</i>
<i>either of fond and meerely literall interpretation, or illiterate misprision.</i>
<i>Perhaps it will be thought to bee of the race of</i> Don Quixote: <i>we both may</i>
<i>confidently sweare, it is his elder above a yeare; and therefore may (by vertue of</i>
<i>his birth-right) challenge the wall of him. I doubt not but they will meet in</i>
<i>their adventures, and I hope the breaking of one staffe will make them friends;</i>
<i>and perhaps they will combine themselves, and travell through the world to seeke</i>
<i>their adventures. So I commit him to his good fortune, and my selfe to your</i>
<i>love.</i> | Your assured friend | W. B.</p></div>
